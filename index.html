                        Friday September 13th we are going to see <i><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bare-a-pop-opera-tickets-69950625203">Bare: A Pop Opera</a></i>! Tickets are $15 plus fees.<br> <br>
                        A pulsating, electric contemporary rock musical, BARE follows a group of students at a Catholic boarding school as they grapple with issues of sexuality, identity, and the future. Peter and Jason have fallen in love with each other, but Jason -- a popular athlete -- fears losing his status if he is discovered to be gay. As the group attempts to put up a production of Romeo and Juliet, tensions flare, self-doubt simmers, and Godâ€™s path seems more difficult to find than ever. With a unique sung-through pop score, heart-pounding lyrics, and a cast of bright young characters, BARE is a provocative and utterly honest look at the dangers of baring your soul, and the consequences of continuing to hide.

While many people think that being LGBTQ and being Christian are exclusive, we disagree. We have people of many faith backgrounds with different ways of expericing the intersection of faith and sexuality. </p>

                <p class="long-copy">That there is room for everyone in the kingdom of God. <br><br>

That Christ has infinite love and grace for all people. In light of this belief we view homophobia, transphobia,  xenophobia, racism, and ableism as parts of this fallen world.<br><br>

That Christ calls each of us to honor him in different ways. We respect the calling of each individual whether they live in celibacy or persue loving relationships.<br><br>

That Jesus lived as a perfect example of who we should be. He died and then rose from the dead and will come again.
